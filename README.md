# Departments distribution 

This my first project with ASP Core MVC ,It is a website to distribute student to department passed on every student GPA, by make it easy for student to put their department order from the most wanted to the less with easy way and easy for management to distribute student with just one or two clicks and give them analytics for the most wanted department to the less wanted.

# Why I start this project

the main reason behind that i should select my department by fill a paper form and travel about 3 hours to my faculty and back again and anther 3 hours that mean 6 hours in total just for one paper so i decide to built a way that make it easy for all for me and my faculty
(no one ask me to do that it was just a challenge to my self).

# What I learn from that project

first it was my first Asp Core MVC project so it was new experience throught that i use different tools as bootstrap and Entity framwork core.
throught the project i found my style in coding change and it is different  a lot when i started and  i see that i take wrong decion a lot in model section put at the end it was little better. 

# What should do know 

at the end i see my problem focused on three related section, model , Work with Entity framework core and my database structure,
so i start reading more about EF Core and take course in SQL and read more about ASP core 

# Final result

with no previous experience i found that was not bad and I found that i learned a lot of things and found myself satisfied with what i have done even if not everything works will
